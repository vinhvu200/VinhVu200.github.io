Using tesseractOCR, your phone would be able to recognize texts on a receipt and parse it out line by line. After adding, deleting, and editing the appropriate lines, the user can assign individuals to their various purchase (along with tip and tax) so the application can partition the bill fairly. In retrospect, there is still lots of manual inputs to do but at least it is neatly formatted. Check out my Github for more details!');
